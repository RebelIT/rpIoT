## [rpIoT](https://github.com/RebelIT/rpIoT)
My configurable GOLang based API for a raspberryPi. Used for integrating/controlling rPI's into your home automation or just for general remote management.

1. Configure the API (Configuration Options)
2. Install the API (Deploy it)
3. Use the API (Using this project)
4. profit.

## About this
I originally built this as a home automation add-on.  I have multiple rPIs around the house
doing various things (wall mounted calendar, magic mirror, piHole, garage door opener, OpenSource thermostat, etc...).  Having an API to control these things was a must.   While all of these use cases
have not yet been built into this API they will be soon with a full range of endpoints.


I tried to make this generic enough so you can integrate it into any home automation
system.  for example, OpenHAB custom http device for your smart home to control your
rPI that is GPIO hard wired to something (garage door).


My use case is a custom home automation platform ([gome](https://github.com/RebelIT/gome) (go + home)) that I decided to play around with while I learned a new language,  I fell into GOLang at work, and decided to put what I learned to use at home too and further my knowledge.


I'm hoping others can find this useful and contribute.  

I love home automation, building my own from scratch.  I like GO, I like RaspberryPi's.  Figured this would be fun and useful for me & possibly others.

Happy automating!
